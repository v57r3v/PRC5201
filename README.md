Coursework #1 
Learning Outcomes Assessed:
CLO1 Evaluate the basic principles ofsystem modelling in systems analysis, design and development according to life cycle methodology. (C4, PLO1)
CLO2 Construct appropriate database techniques in conceptual and logical modeling to complete related activities. (P3, PL06)
CLO3 Relate the importance of information security and ethical concernstowards computing context. (C4, PLO2)
Instructions: This assignment consists of THREE (3) parts as follows;
Part 1 
Read the University Management System (UMS) Case Study below:
The University Management System (UMS) 
A mid-sized university seeks to develop a comprehensive University Management System (UMS) to streamline its administrative processes and improve student services. The current system is largely manual, leading to inefficiencies and data errors.
Background 
Based on preliminary research and fact-finding, the UMS includes components
• Student Management
o Student registration and enrolment
o Course registration and schedule management
o Management of student records (transcripts, attendance, etc.)
• Course Management
o Creation and management of course offerings by faculty.
o Assignment of instructors to courses.
You will now proceed with the systems analysis phase by developing an object-oriented model of the UMS.
Tasks 
1. Design at least four class objects for the University Management System (UMS) including attributes and methods.
2. Create a class diagram for the system classes that you identified in Task 1 (above).
3. Are there any classes in the UMS 代 写PRC5201 Fundamental of ComputingJava

4. Design a use case model for a method in the new system.
Part 2 
Based on the Case Study from Part 1, you are required to design and develop a database for the University Management System (UMS) using Microsoft Office Access. You are expected to complete the following tasks: -
Tasks 
1. Identify relevant business rules related to the Case Study
2. Identify relevant entities and attributes.
3. Draw an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) related to the Case Study
4. From the ERD, create database Table with proper primary key, foreign keys and database relationship.
Upon completion of the above tasks, you are required to document all the completed task including the screenshot of created Tables and relationships.
Part 3 
Based on the Case Study from Part 1, as the Chief Network Security Officer, you are required to investigate and produce a report on the network security requirements needed for this university.
You are to produce a complete set of computer security policies and procedure for the director. The breakdown of the report is as follow:
1.0 Executive Summary
2.0 Background Introduction
3.0 Business Strategy
4.0 Threat, Risk  Vulnerability Analysis
5.0 Policies and Goal Security
6.0 Security Policy
7.0 Physical Security
8.0 Network Security architectures, designs
9.0 Operating System and Data Security
10.0 Cryptography
11.0 Ethics
12.0 Privacy
13.0 Intellectual Property
14.0 Conclusion
15.0 References
